# ClimaticTimeSeriesMissingValuesInput

Abstract. This work presents an application developed for the generation of
missing data in time series, using meteorological data as input parameters. The
application uses data from a set of four different cities, containing three climate indicators: maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation. The proposed tool is able not only to complete time series that have data
gaps, but also to generate a complete time series for a city that does not have any
data. The system uses data triangulation, machine learning and meta-learning
algorithms.
